# PunchApp

A small mobile app that should be able to works as a punchclock using a github repository, using a backend in python to commit.

My motivation was that i easily get distracted and often i forget to do it myself, so automating this part of the process it gets a lot easier to me.

## TO-DO:
  * Backend in python:
    * Ability to commit to a repository a txt file that gets updated with the initial working hour.
    * Also be able to commit the end hour of work with whats was done during the time.
  * Frontend in react-native:
    * Be able to communicate with the backend passing the data of name of the user, start hour of work, end hour of work and reason.
    
## Know issues:
  My ability to do iu interfaces from scratch without it looking like it was done by a 6 year old.
